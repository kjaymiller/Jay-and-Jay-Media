<p>
We take your audio, optimize the sound quality (strip silence and equalize and levelize the content),¬† reduce the "Ums" and "Ahs" (but leave just enough it so it sounds natural).
</p>

<p>
If you want it the episode cut for length we can also do that (<em>additional costs apply</em>).
</p>

<p>
Finally, we attach your intro/outro music onto it.

<p>
We use the Amazon Transcript algorithm to get the baseline of your content. It's great because it can do things like recognize different speakers. Of course, there are a lot of words that don't come standard, we use added word dictionaries to help with that.
</p>
<p>
We can't automate the entire process (pretty darn close though), so we also manually go through each the episode and make any corrections by hand (and add any new dictionary entries as they come up).¬†

## Here are some other Services around Podcasting

### Publishing 
*Starting at $5*
<small>(add-on to <em>Editing</em>, does not include the cost of hosting)</small>
If you need hosting added to that, we get you setup with either a libsyn (great for hosting just one podcast) or¬†transistor.fm¬†(better for multiple podcasts) account (That you own.) Your price with transistor varies with the popularity of the podcast. We then manage the uploading and show notes.

If you have your own plan for hosting, we can follow that as well (pricing may vary based on the the complexity but usually it is the same rate)

Turnaround is 24 hours from Editing Completion and Approval.

### Social Media Promotion
*$10 for 5 posts (unlimited channels).* 
<small>Additional Posts are $2/per post.)</small>
After the podcast episode has been released we also can put together a series of tweets to help promote the show. These would have images, quotes from the episode, links to subscribe and any other promotional content you may want.¬†

*Our [Newsletter Services](./newsletter_services) also Pair well with your podcast!*
