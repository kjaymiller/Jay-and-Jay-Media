Title: A podcast is a way to let your audience know what you're about.

We understand that it's not easy to jump on the mic and make the next big podcast. That's why we are here to help you!

<h2 class="card-title">Editing</h2>
<div class="card-body">
<span class="font-italic">(Starting at $45 per hour of RAW (not-edited) content)</span> 

We take your audio, optimize the sound quality (strip silence and equalize and levelize the content),  reduce the "Ums" and "Ahs" (but leave just enough it so it sounds natural).

If you want it the episode cut for length we can also do that (additional cost as it usually requires more back and forth with the customer).

Finally, we attach your intro/outro music onto it. Turnaround for this 72 hours from receiving all materials.

We use the Amazon Transcript algorithm to get the baseline of your content. It's great because it can do things like recognize different speakers. Of course with tech podcasts, there are a lot of words that don't come standard, we use an added word dictionary to help with that.

Of course, we can't program out everything in that process, so we also manually go through the episode and make any corrections by hand (and add any new dictionary entries as they come up).  

Turnaround is 48 hours from Receipt of Content.

### Other Services around Podcasting
### Publishing - Starting at $5
<small>(add-on to <em>Editing</em>, does not include the cost of hosting)</small>
If you need hosting added to that, we get you setup with either a libsyn (great for hosting just one podcast) or transistor.fm (better for multiple podcasts) account (That you own.) Your price with transistor varies with the popularity of the podcast. We then manage the uploading and show notes.

If you have your own plan for hosting, we can follow that as well (pricing may vary based on the the complexity but usually it is the same rate)

Turnaround is 24 hours from Editing Completion and Approval.

### Social Media Promotion
<small>($10 for 5 posts (unlimited channels). Additional Posts are $2/per post.)</small>
After the podcast episode has been released we also can put together a series of tweets to help promote the show. These would have images, quotes from the episode, links to subscribe and any other promotional content you may want.
