# A podcast is a way to let your audience know what you're about. 

We understand that it's not easy to jump on the mic and make the next big podcast. That's why we are here to help you!

**If you need a hand getting started**, you can schedule us for a podcasting crash-course. We look at your budget and help you come up with the best possible podcasting setup. Whether you are in your closet (where many of our podcasts are recorded) or a private recording space, we have a solution that works for you!

**Maybe you need help maintaining your podcast** or getting the conversation from recorded to published. We have everything you need to make you sound great!

**Don't forget about accessibility!** Our publishing services include publishing to all major podcast platforms and even YouTube. There are also transcription services. 

Once your latest episode airs, **the job isn't done**. You need to let your audience know about it. We've got you covered! We construct a social media publishing schedule that coincides with your scheduled releases. We can also send regularly scheduled updates to your newsletter subscribers and help you run email campaigns to help grow your audience.
