*Do People Even Listen?*

Earlier this week I ask people for help coming up with a companion for my notebook for maintaining checklists. I told them I wanted something simple that wasn't an entire task management tool. 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I want an app that just gives me a simplified checklists to strike-through. <br><br>Any ideas?<br><br>Not looking for a task manager or project/life manager. <br><br>A lists of tasks that are either all completed or the thing Iâ€™m doing is not done.</p>&mdash; Jay Miller (@kjaymiller) <a href="https://twitter.com/kjaymiller/status/1100270567872028672?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 26, 2019</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> 

Oh wow, I'm a dingbat...

This post was originally going to be on the fact that I people continuously gave me task management solutions when I SPECIFICALLY didn't ask for one.  I spent the entire morning irked at the idea that people don't listen. As I looked up the original tweet I noticed that I SPECIFICALLY DID ASK for an App.

The solution that I went with finally ([Baron Fig Mastermind Note Cards](https://www.baronfig.com/products/strategist)) was exactly what I was looking for, BUT NO ONE WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SUGGEST IT BECAUSE I SAID "APP".

So the answer to my earlier question is **YES! They do listen**. Just make sure that what you are telling them is what you want them to hear.
