            <p><strong>When you are creating content, what is your voice?</strong> </p>
<p>Content creators, over time develop a "sound" in their content. </p>
<p>I notice when I interview guests for the <a href="https://productivityintech.transistor.fm/subscribe">Productivity in Tech Podcast</a> , the southern accent goes away (except for when I'm talking to my fellow southerners). I sound calm, yet excited, and confident that I'm going to ask my guest good questions. </p>
<p><em>But that's just when I'm recording the interview</em>, when I record my intro and outro (at a later time), I talk faster and in a more excited tone. I feel like I'm no longer talking with my guest (because I'm not), but instead talking with my audience. They <strong>ARE</strong> my friends and I am talking with them as if I were speaking with a friend. </p>
<p>Even before the interview, I'm relaxed and more <em>casual</em>. This helps my guests feel more relaxed. </p>
<p><em>But it doesn't stop there...</em></p>
<ul>
<li>If I'm teaching someone something, I go into my "Instructor Voice". </li>
<li>When I'm promoting something, I go into my "excited to bring this product to you" voice. </li>
</ul>
<p>Many of the content creators that I see are not effectively presenting their creation with the proper voice. They all sound like Ben Stein taking role. </p>
<ul>
<li>New Product Launch --  "Bueller"</li>
<li>Podcast interview -- "Bueller"</li>
<li>Technical Post -- "Bueller"</li>
</ul>

<strong>Here are a few ways that you can improve on your <em>voice</em>:</strong></p>
<h3>1.  Who is your audience?</h3>
<p>Is this your audience?</p>
<p><img alt="Reserved" src="https://media3.giphy.com/media/42zi6DYnyRE4S3c5uG/giphy.gif" /></p>
<p>Or this...</p>
<p><img alt="Rowdy" src="https://media1.giphy.com/media/l41YeqkqbS29kGnCw/giphy.gif" /></p>
<p>Your tone should match who are you addressing.  Creating for potential job interviewers will often differ from creating for your friends and fellow community members.</p>
<p>Don't look at this as <em>misleading</em> as you would probably speak differently to your mother than you would your best friend. </p>
<p>You are simply trying to provide a level of <em>professionalism</em> or <em>casualness</em> that the desired audience is looking for.</p>
<h3>2. It's Really Hard to Fake Yourself</h3>
<p>Have you ever put in hours on content just to review it and feel like it isn't that great? Usually it's because you are not being "True" to yourself.</p>
<p>I know that I just wrote a paragraph saying that your tone will change. That's perfectly fine if your tone changes. If it sounds like you are trying to force it, you probably are.  </p>
<p>It's like wearing a mask. People can see the mask but they know that it is hiding something underneath. </p>
<p>Pull off the mask and present your true self!!</p>

<h3>3. Comfort Comes Through Repetition and (Self) Compromise</h3>
<p>A few years ago, I would aways use the word "guys" to mean a group of people. When I started working with more individuals who were more conscious of their pronouns, I noticed that saying "You guys" would occasionally make them feel uneasy. </p>
<p>It was hard to stop saying "guys" to mean a group. I employed a few friends to point it out to me when it happened. That helped some, but what helped most was when my friend Kenneth Love taught me a trick that he used to teach many python developers. </p>
<p><strong>EMBRACE THE Y'ALL</strong></p>

<p>By compromising and letting a little of my <em>southern ways</em> squeak out. I was able to give better presentations and feel more comfortable in the process.</p>
<p><hr>
I'm not <strong>Ira Glass</strong>, with that buttery smooth NPR narration. I'm not <strong>Morgan Freeman</strong>, who's voice always takes me back to Bruce Almighty, Driving Miss Daisy, and Shawshank Redemption.</p>
<p>My audience isn't looking for me to be either of those people. Instead they want me to be Jay. A quirky, enthusiastic, and friendly voice that helps people feel welcome and capable. </p>
<p>What do you "Sound" like? Let me know by replying to this email! </p>
<p>If you don't know yet, consider scheduling a one-time marketing consultation with me and I will do my best to help you identify it and show you some more ways to bring it out!</p>
