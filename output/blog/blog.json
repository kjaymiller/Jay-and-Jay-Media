I spent the entire morning irked at the idea that people don't listen. As I looked up the original tweet I noticed that I SPECIFICALLY DID ASK for an App. The solution that I went with finally (<a href=\"https://www.baronfig.com/products/strategist\">Baron Fig Mastermind Note Cards</a>) was exactly what I was looking for, but no one would have been able to suggest it because I said \"App\".</p>\n<p>So the answer to my earlier question is <strong>YES! They do listen</strong>. Just make sure that what you are telling them is what you want them to hear.  </p>", "summary": "<p><em>Do People Even Listen?</em></p>\n<p>Earlier this week I ask people for help coming up with a companion for my notebook for maintaining checklists...</p>", "date_published": "2019-02-26T08:02:00+00:00", "date_modified": "2019-02-26T16:02:00+00:00"}, {"id": "your_voice", "url": "https://jayandjay.media/blog/your_voice", "title": "Understanding your Voice with your Content", "content_html": "<p><strong>When you are creating content, what is your voice?</strong> </p>\n<p>Content creators, over time develop a \"sound\" in their content. </p>\n<p>I notice when I interview guests for the <a href=\"https://productivityintech.transistor.fm/subscribe\">Productivity in Tech Podcast</a> , the southern accent goes away (except for when I'm talking to my fellow southerners). I sound calm, yet excited, and confident that I'm going to ask my guest good questions. </p>\n<p><em>But that's just when I'm recording the interview</em>, when I record my intro and outro (at a later time), I talk faster and in a more excited tone. I feel like I'm no longer talking with my guest (because I'm not), but instead talking with my audience. They <strong>ARE</strong> my friends and I am talking with them as if I were speaking with a friend. </p>\n<p>Even before the interview, I'm relaxed and more <em>casual</em>. This helps my guests feel more relaxed. </p>\n<p><em>But it doesn't stop there...</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>If I'm teaching someone something, I go into my \"Instructor Voice\". </li>\n<li>When I'm promoting something, I go into my \"excited to bring this product to you\" voice. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Many of the content creators that I see are not effectively presenting their creation with the proper voice. They all sound like Ben Stein taking role. </p>\n<ul>\n<li>New Product Launch --  \"Bueller\"</li>\n<li>Podcast interview -- \"Bueller\"</li>\n<li>Technical Post -- \"Bueller\"</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://media3.giphy.com/media/MkxZKy77sWoEw/giphy.gif\" /></p>\n<p><hr>\n<strong>Here are a few ways that you can improve on your <em>voice</em>:</strong></p>\n<h3>1.  Who is your audience?</h3>\n<p>Is this your audience?</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Reserved\" src=\"https://media3.giphy.com/media/42zi6DYnyRE4S3c5uG/giphy.gif\" /></p>\n<p>Or this...</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Rowdy\" src=\"https://media1.giphy.com/media/l41YeqkqbS29kGnCw/giphy.gif\" /></p>\n<p>Your tone should match who are you addressing.  Creating for potential job interviewers will often differ from creating for your friends and fellow community members.</p>\n<p>Don't look at this as <em>misleading</em> as you would probably speak differently to your mother than you would your best friend. </p>\n<p>You are simply trying to provide a level of <em>professionalism</em> or <em>casualness</em> that the desired audience is looking for.</p>\n<h3>2. It's Really Hard to Fake Yourself</h3>\n<p>Have you ever put in hours on content just to review it and feel like it isn't that great? Usually it's because you are not being \"True\" to yourself.</p>\n<p>I know that I just wrote a paragraph saying that your tone will change. That's perfectly fine if your tone changes. If it sounds like you are trying to force it, you probably are.  </p>\n<p>It's like wearing a mask. People can see the mask but they know that it is hiding something underneath. </p>\n<p>Pull off the mask and present your true self!!</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://media3.giphy.com/media/ZOaJaArjRaHJe/giphy.gif\" /></p>\n<h3>3. Comfort Comes Through Repetition and (Self) Compromise</h3>\n<p>A few years ago, I would aways use the word \"guys\" to mean a group of people. When I started working with more individuals who were more conscious of their pronouns, I noticed that saying \"You guys\" would occasionally make them feel uneasy. </p>\n<p>It was hard to stop saying \"guys\" to mean a group. I employed a few friends to point it out to me when it happened. That helped some, but what helped most was when my friend Kenneth Love taught me a trick that he used to teach many python developers. </p>\n<p><strong>EMBRACE THE Y'ALL</strong></p>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/FMwU1rszahE?start=678\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n<p>By compromising and letting a little of my <em>southern ways</em> squeak out. I was able to give better presentations and feel more comfortable in the process.</p>\n<p><hr>\nI'm not <strong>Ira Glass</strong>, with that buttery smooth NPR narration. I'm not <strong>Morgan Freeman</strong>, who's voice always takes me back to Bruce Almighty, Driving Miss Daisy, and Shawshank Redemption.</p>\n<p>My audience isn't looking for me to be either of those people. Instead they want me to be Jay. A quirky, enthusiastic, and friendly voice that helps people feel welcome and capable. </p>\n<p>What do you \"Sound\" like?
